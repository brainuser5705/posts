My study plan to improve (and some rambling on) my vocabulary. Just a simple note to self.

--- 

The main struggle is having to balance *learn* and *review* words. Let's say I'm reading a book, and it has a bunch of new vocabulary. Should I add every single word to my Anki flashcard deck as soon as I see it (or more realistically, the end of my reading session) or limit myself to only a few so I don't overload myself. And this is especially hard to decide when I encounter 20+ words (flashback to *Catch-22*). BUt I guess that's the point. The reason why I need to write down so many words is because my vocabulary bank is barren. The only way I will remember its meaning is if I put it in the deck and utilize it. It has to be **active** practice. I can't just let it sit stagnant.

## Die Planne

Should be an everyday thing. Whatever the Anki deck presents, so custom scheduling and how many words are not a concern for me.

1. Anki review
    - currently have it set to 10 cards a day
2. Write a story or something that uses those words.

There's a buttload of other things I could do (like playing games, etc.) but it's going to be to much to handle at the moment. Start small first.
