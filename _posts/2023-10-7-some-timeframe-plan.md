30 Day challenge, one year plan, five year plan, ten year plan, the list goes on. I don't necessarily have a specific timeframe (hence the title), but if I want to cop a co-op within the next year or so, I need to hone down a solid plan for myself. Based off a quick Google seaerch I just did right now, there is SMART goals and HARD goals. There are probably a bajillion other systems out there, and there's also the good old-fashioned motto from Shia LeBouf, "just do it". In the past (primiarly referencing that one summer I was working on my personal website), it was mostly me with random surges of energy just hacking away. And it kind of worked, but I definitely wasn't the most "well-rounded" person during the point of my life. As much as I was working on the website, my physical and mental health was pretty much shit. Now that I'm older and wiser (...), and have gained some more awareness of myself and my antics, it is better if I have set goals and a concrete outcome that I want to achieve in the long-term. On a smaller scale, it means that I will have something to do each day and with less distractions. So it makes perfect sense to have a plan set down if I am serious.
