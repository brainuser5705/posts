list of projects that I want to do and will attempt to do whenever I have the time to do them

---

Listed along with the project name are their description, motivation, estimated timeframe (how much time I want to spend on it), priority, suspected difficulty in this order.

- **More readable html tool**
    - Chrome extension that allows users to shrink and center the `body` of webpage to make things more readable
    - b/c some HTML pages are too damn annoying to read (when the text is spans the entire width of the screen)
    - a day or two, hackathon-type project
    - low
    - medium, not going to be easy since I'll have to learn a new "framework" and APIs
- **Car brake simulator**
    - electrical circuit simulation of car brakes and signaling
    - need to grow electrical engineering knowledge
    - more than a day
    - medium
    - hard because i am new to electronics
