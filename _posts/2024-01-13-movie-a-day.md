Starting Christmas Day, I watched 1-2 movies (almost) everyday. This is a brief reflection.

## Why?

You ever just see something you want to do, but not at the exact moment, so you put it in your backlog waiting for some other time to come where you will finally do the thing? That's me with Netflix movies. I spot a movie that I want to watch (maybe the synposis is interesting, or the movie is well-regarded and I should see what's up with it), but I don't feel like sitting around for a whole two hours and a half, so I press "Add to My List". An ingenious feature. You don't have to remember or keep note of the movies you "will" watch, just gotta press a simple button an be on your merry way.

But as easy and convenient as it sounds, it's also a bit anxiety-inducing. Seeing all the movies you want to watch while simultaneously adding more movies to the list, eventually you start questioning your own ability to stay put and watch a movie in full. Actually, I have tried watching a few movies off my list but never was able to finish any of them because my attention span was so volatile. Basically, what's the point of adding movies when I won't even watch them in the first place?

And so, being upset with myself, I decided to embark on this "experiment" of watching a movie a day.

## What happened?

One movie, eventually turned into two movies. It started off a little wary. I was still have some FOMO and continue adding more movies than I could possibly watch, and I felt I had to forced myself to stay attentive. I mean it wasn't that bad, most of the movies I picked were engaging enough. But slowly I got into it. I think one of the things really helped me stick to the experiment (besides being a easy excuse not to do work) was tracking the movies I watch. I made a list on a site called *The Movie DB* and would add the next movie I watched along with some commentary. It was fun watching the list grow.

## Now what?

My brain hurts. I think I watched too much movies. It's starting to become a chore now. I should watch a movie to enjoy it. Not for the sake of watching. I don't know. I'm taking a break.
