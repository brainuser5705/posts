I've been in a standstill in my "computer science journey" since last year after I finished my first software engineering co-op. I ended it feeling lost and unmotivated; the biggest takeaway was the realization that I cannot do something that I am not passionate about. I mean I could, but I don't want to. It made me question why I was even studying computer science and my life purpose in general. I felt I was wasting my life away not doing something that truly made me happy, but at the same time, I didn't know what made me happy (still figuring it out too this day).

Since starting college and taking on personal projects, I've always said to myself that I was interested in something and ready to trench into the unknowns. But each time I would start, spend roughly a week or two studying, only to completely drop it and never getting past the introductory phase. I've done this with machine learning, programming languages, operating systems, game development, etc. Is it because I have a problem with commitment? Or am I just a poser? But it's pretty tiring to have to relearn everything over and over again because I can't just stick to one thing.

Somewhat related was my relationship with myself. Low self-confidence, low self-esteem, low-everything. I don't necessarily hate myself, but there's a lot of me that I want to change. It was only recently that I learned the value of self-care. Did you know that making sure you eat healthy and sleep well improves your life substantially?

For a more concrete realization, I realize that I am bored of web dev. Most of my projects, if not all, are web dev. I am by no means a web dev expert and there's a bunch of things that I have yet to learn but it's got to the point where learning a new web dev concept is hell for me. I hate having to comb the internet and read a bunch of tutorials just to make a fucking div centered (obviously this is dramatic, but still I hate reading). But at the same time, how the else am I going to learn? I have to read documentation, go through tutorials, and figure things out. That's literally the process of learning in this field.

**So what's the solution? What is the call to action?**

I am setting on a new chapter. I have acquired enough experiences (good and bad) that has taught me how I should live my life so I am the most healthy and productive I can be. I don't have big dreams or goals. All I want is to find something that I am excited about in the field of computer science, something that makes me want to learn more. So to be succint:

## Priorities
- Learning embedded systems development
- Badminton practice
- Schoolwork

## Remember
- One thing at a time, just pick and go with it
