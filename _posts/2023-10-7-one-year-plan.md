# Introduction

If I'm serious about embedded development, the least I need to do for myself is hone down on a plan. zSince I am planning on doing my co-op within in the next year, I'll set that as the "deadline" for this self-led deep dive into embedded systems. So by making a one-year plan, I'll  have a better idea of what I need to do and also hold me accountable for reaching the monthly goals I set for monthly goals I set. Since I am very new to the world of embdedded systems and unaware of what there is to learn in the field, this plan is a work in progress for now.

# Plan

Year Goal:
- Abstract: To obtain a new interest and skillset in Embedded Systems
- Concrete: To obtain a co-op doing Embedded Systems
 
Rough breakdown of phases:
- Oct to Dec: In school - Focus on C++/C, basic electrical engineering with Arduino
- Jan to April: Break - 
- April to July:
- July to August:


| Month | Goal | How |
|---|---|---|
| Oct-Nov | Learn and become more fluent in CPP, Obtain basic understanding of electrical engineering in Arduino setting | Exercism (3 problems a day) & CPP textbook (chapter a week), Arduino (basic examples), EE book (chapter a week) |
