A rambling about classical music. No ranting.

As I write, the classical music community are sharpening their pitchforks and lighting up their torches. How can a non-musical, incapable of deep abstract thought, unfathomly uncultured swine like me ever write about the reverential, timeless genre of classical music? Well, that's exactly what I'll be exploring in this post. I don't get classical music. Why is that?

## My thoughts on the genre

For about 7-8 years of my childhood, I played piano. Contrary to what you might believe from reading that, I have absolutely no connection to the genre. No memorable pieces I played, no emotional assocations that illicit when listening to classical music, absolutely butt nothing from all those years I played. In all honesty, all I remember is:
- sharp and flat notes
- there exist scales...do I know how to play them? probably c major but that's it
- Uh...beats and measures are a thing?
- like 10 seconds of Canon in D and some jingle I learned

And that is from nearly a decade of "piano lessons".

So I'm not new to classical music, yet I am very new to classical music. 

Actually I lied. Maybe I do have emotional associations when listening to classical music. But not good ones. It's been a while and I blocked off my memories of it, but I remember gradually losing interest playing piano and eventually gaining a hatred for it. I felt like I was being forced to play for the sake of doing lessons and passing exams than actually enjoying the music. Once I finally was able to quit, I actively avoided listening to any piano or classical musical instrument. The last moments of my piano years were not fun, and I think it left a indelible mark on me since then. So now whenever I heard the chords of a piano or a shrill of a violin, I feel some anger and guilt as I think back to those days.

But enough trauma dumping. Besides the music itself, the entire classical music world was really not my vibe to put it straight. Having been in the "scene" first handedly - going to exams, playing at recitals, having to dress up all the time, having to make sure I was on my A-game every single performance like my life depended on it - was hell. And this was only as an extracurricular as a kid. Imagine doing this in the ruthless, unforgiving professional industry. Apparently the chances of being accepted into a orchestra (or whatever the term is) are lower than getting drafted into the NBA. It also gives off a high brow, elitist aura, as if you have to be of "class" and "education" to understand the beauty of the music. So if you don't get what's so good about a piece, it's because your mind is too clogged up with BTS, Justin Bieber, or some other lowly trash pop artist. I felt this especially when learning about music theory. What is the point of me remembering all these Italian words for different speeds to play? All these different concepts and terminology that were forced upon me felt unnecessary, but it felt like if I didn't get it, I wasn't worthy of playing.

## Theories

I don't know. Maybe classical musicians and connoissers are just on a different brainwave than a mere mortal like me. All my feeble mind can understand is the simple block structure of pop: you got a verse, then the chorus, then more verses, maybe a bridge for some spiciness and boom, I'm hooked. I consulted Reddit (yes.) and read up on some threads answering "why some people dislike classical music" and one theory was persistent: familiarity.

Because I mainly listen to pop music, it makes sense for me try to fit any music I learn into that pop formula, If it doesn't, it would sound weird and unnatural. Related to this: a song or musical piece might not be love at first hearing, but could grow on me as it becomes more familiar to my ears. I know what to expect and can enjoy it without needing to decipher what the music is trying to do.

Perhaps that is how I hear classical music right now. A puzzle that makes absolutely no sense. What is the piece trying to tell me? How is it trying to make me feel? With pop, it's easy to identify the general mood (happy, upbeat or sad, mellow). With classical and its highs/lows among its intricacies and nuances my ears are unaware of, there is a different approach to understanding it.

## Actually listening

For a chunk of the night, I was experimenting with classical music and found a playlist of recommended pieces curated by the NY Times - "5 minutes [to fall in love with classical music]" or something like that. Mostly sounded like movie scores. There was one piece "Vingt regards sur l'Enfant-Jésus: 15. Le baiser de l'Enfant-Jésus" which was >12 minutes long. And I had no idea what I was listening to. What I wrote in the previous section perfectly describes how I felt - where is piece trying to do? It was like I was listening to some guy on the piano, playing random snippets of various songs like they were practicing not performing. Nothing sounded cohesive. There was no buildup to a grand finale.

## Closing thoughts

These are my late night thoughts about classical music. If I sounded naive, then you're probably right. I barely listen to classical music to start off with, so to have a solid, reputable opinion about it doesn't really make sense. All I can do is keep listening and see what comes from it.
